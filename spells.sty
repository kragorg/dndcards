        school=Abjuration,
        attack=None,
        effect=Detection
    ]{Alarm}
    You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental:

    \textbf{Audible Alarm.} The alarm produces the sound of a handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet of the warded area.

    \textbf{Mental Alarm.} You are alerted by a mental ping if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you're asleep.

    ]{Alter Self}

    You alter your physical form. Choose one of the following options.
    Its effects last for the duration, during which you can take a
    Magic action to replace the option you chose with a different
    one.

    \textbf{Aquatic Adaptation.} You sprout gills and grow webs between
    your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a Swim Speed
    equal to your Speed.

    \textbf{Change Appearance.} You alter your appearance. You decide
    what you look like, including your height, weight, facial
    features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and
    other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself
    appear as a member of another species, though none of your
    statistics change. You can't appear as a creature of a different
    size, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal,
    you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance.
    For the duration, you can take a Magic action to change your
    appearance in this way again.

    \textbf{Natural Weapons.} You grow claws (Slashing), fangs
    (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you
    use your Unarmed Strike to deal damage with that new growth, it
    deals $1d6$ damage of the type in parentheses instead of dealing
    the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike, and you use your
    spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls
    rather than using Strength.

      attack=CHA Save,
      effect=Communication
    ]{Animal Messenger}
    A Tiny Beast of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or it attempts to deliver a message for you (if the target's Challenge Rating isn't 0, it automatically succeeds). You specify a location you have visited and a recipient who matches a general description, such as ``a person dressed in the uniform of the town guard'' or ``a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.'' You also communicate a message of up to twenty-five words. The Beast travels for the duration toward the specified location, covering about 25 miles per 24 hours or 50 miles if the Beast can fly.

    When the Beast arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, mimicking your communication. If the Beast doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the Beast returns to where you cast the spell.

    ]{Armor of Agathys}
    Protective magical frost surrounds you. You gain 5 Temporary Hit Points. If a creature hits you with a melee attack roll before the spell ends, the creature takes 5 Cold damage. The spell ends early if you have no Temporary Hit Points.

    \textbf{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.} The Temporary Hit Points and the Cold damage both increase by 5 for each spell slot level above 1.

    One Humanoid you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with Advantage if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it. The Charmed creature is Friendly to you. When the spell ends, the target knows it was Charmed by you.

    \textbf{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.} You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.

    ]{Chromatic Orb}
    You hurl an orb of energy at a target within range. Choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes $3d8$ damage of the chosen type.

    If you roll the same number on two or more of the $d8$s, the orb leaps to a different target of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Make an attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll. The orb can't leap again unless you cast the spell with a level $2+$ spell slot.

    \textbf{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.} The damage increases by $1d8$ for each spell slot level above 1. The orb can leap a maximum number of times equal to the level of the slot expended, and a creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

    ]{Clairvoyance}
    You create an Invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The intangible, invulnerable sensor remains in place for the duration.

    When you cast the spell, choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As a Bonus Action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.

    A creature that sees the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from \textit{See Invisibility} or Truesight) sees a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

    You conjure spinning daggers in a 5-foot Cube centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area takes $4d4$ Slashing damage. A creature also takes this damage if it enters the Cube or ends its turn there or if the Cube moves into its space. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.

    On your later turns, you can take a Magic action to teleport the Cube up to 30 feet.

    \textbf{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.} The damage increases by $2d4$ for each spell slot level above 2.

    You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. Choose the command from these options:

    \textbf{Approach.} The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

    \textbf{Drop.} The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

    \textbf{Flee.} The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

    \textbf{Grovel.} The target has the Prone condition and then ends its turn.

    \textbf{Halt.} On its turn, the target doesn't move and takes no action or Bonus Action.

    Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or that target can't take Bonus Actions or Reactions and must roll $1d10$ at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn, consulting the following table.

    \textbf{Sense Thoughts.} You sense the presence of thoughts within 30 feet of yourself that belong to creatures that know languages or are telepathic. You don't read the thoughts, but you know that a thinking creature is present.

    The spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.

    \textbf{Read Thoughts.} Target one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself or one creature within 30 feet of yourself that you detected with the Sense Thoughts option. You learn what is most on the target's mind right now. If the target doesn't know any languages and isn't telepathic, you learn nothing.

    As a Magic action on your next turn, you can try to probe deeper into the target's mind. If you probe deeper, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you discern the target's reasoning, emotions, and something that looms large in its mind (such as a worry, love, or hate). On a successful save, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and until you shift your attention away from the target's mind, the target can take an action on its turn to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC, ending the spell on a success.

    You make yourself---including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person---look different until the spell ends. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

    The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing.

    To discern that you are disguised, a creature must take the Study action to inspect your appearance and succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

    You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: Bat, Cat, Frog, Hawk, Lizard, Octopus, Owl, Rat, Raven, Spider, Weasel, or another Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 0. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.

    \textbf{Telepathic Connection.} While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.

    Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.

    \textbf{Combat.} The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

    \textbf{Disappearance of the Familiar.} When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.

    \textbf{One Familiar Only.} You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.

    A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

    When you cast the spell, you can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial.

    As a Magic action on your later turns, you can control the hand thus again. As part of that action, you can move the hand up to 30 feet.

    The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

    You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but it can't deal damage or cause conditions.

    If you are within range of the illusion, you can take a Magic action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. You can also cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation.

    Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, as things can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

    \textbf{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.} The spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring Concentration, if cast with a 4th-level or higher spell slot.

    You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends if you cast this spell again.

    If a creature takes a Study action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

    \textbf{Sound.} If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

    You craft an illusion in the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other phenomenon of your choice (no larger than a 10-foot Cube) that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli.

    The target treats the phantasm as if it were real, rationalizing any illogical outcomes. If the phantasm is a dangerous creature or hazard, it deals $2d8$ Psychic damage to the target on each of your turns if the target is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of it. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

    The target can take a Study action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target realizes the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

    Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, or that have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell.

        You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot
        Cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
        be affected by this spell for the duration.

        An affected target's Speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and
        Dexterity saving throws, and it can't take Reactions. On its turns, it
        can take either an action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can make
        only one attack if it takes the Attack action. If it casts a spell with
        a Somatic component, there is a 25 percent chance the spell fails as a
        result of the target making the spell's gestures too slowly.

        An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns,
        ending the spell on itself on a success.

        You cast sorcerous energy at one creature or object within

        the target takes $1d8$ damage of a type you choose: Acid, Cold,
        Fire, Lightning, Poison, Psychic, or Thunder.

        If you roll an 8 on a $d8$ for this spell, you can roll another
        $d8$, and add it to the damage. When you cast this spell, the
        maximum number of these $d8$s you can add to the spell's damage
        equals your spellcasting ability modifier.

        \textbf{Cantrip Upgrade.} The damage increases by $1d8$ when you
        reach levels 5 ($2d8$), 11 ($3d8$), and 17 ($4d8$).

    You suggest a course of activity---described in no more than 25 words---to one creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. The suggestion must sound achievable and not involve anything that would obviously deal damage to the target or its allies. For example, you could say, ``Fetch the key to the cult's treasure vault, and give the key to me.'' Or you could say, ``Stop fighting, leave this library peacefully, and don't return.''

    The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage to the target. The Charmed target pursues the suggestion to the best of its ability. The suggested activity can continue for the entire duration, but if the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends for the target upon completing it.

    You call forth an aberrant spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the Aberrant Spirit stat block.

    The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.
